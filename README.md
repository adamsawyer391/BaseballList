# BaseballList
Developed in Android Studio to demonstrate the use of fragments, different layouts for different sized screens, and the use of a dual-pane feature for larger screens.
The user can scroll through a list of baseball teams and select one to display the details of the team either in another activity or in another adjacent fragment in dual pane mode for use in tablets.
